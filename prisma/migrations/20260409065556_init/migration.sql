  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the `User` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - Changed the type of `duration` on the `Video` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.

ALTER TABLE "Video" DROP COLUMN "duration",
ADD COLUMN     "duration" DOUBLE PRECISION NOT NULL;
